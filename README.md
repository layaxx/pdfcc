# PDF Color Changer

This is a proof of concept web app that allows for colors of text and paths in a PDF to be substituted.

It is currently quite messy as i put it together over the course of less than two days. 

Plans for the future include adding a functionality to analyse a given PDF and list every Color that is used inside, allowing for those colors to be options in the substitution process.
